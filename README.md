# 📈 Panel Highcharts

We want to

- make it super simple to do **exploratory data analysis** and develop high-quality
[Panel](https://awesome-panel.org) **data apps** using the [HighCharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) plotting library.

We provide

- the [`panel-highcharts`](https://pypi.org/project/panel-highcharts/) python package for Panel.
- example notebooks and data apps.
